This is a simple poll system developed for Cardiff University Gravity Group. It is  
developed based on opensource code from http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16736/A- 
Simple-PHP-Polling-Voting-System

Features:
1. Integrate with shibboleth login
2. Authenticated users can generate and vote for polls
3. Voting eligibility control
4. A user is only allowed to vote once
5. Archiving polls
6. Data is stored by xml files.

Install:
1. Put the code under apache document root, e.g. /var/www/html/poll
2. Protect the poll/ folder with shibboleth credentials.

Note:
This code is specifically developed for our own (LIGO) use cases. For example, we  
hardcoded "cn", "isMemberof" attributes for user authentication and authorization. Future version  will provide config file for easier configuration for different use cases.
